# Tensorflow-Digit-Classification
This python script uses tensorflow keras to import the MNist handwritten digit repository, then using a convolutional neural network, teaches the neural network how to read them. At the end it will print out sample pictures of the handwritten digits, the actual answer, and the prediction by the model you just taught.
